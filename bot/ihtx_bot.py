"""
IHTX Bot — I Hate The X FFmpeg Discord Bot

Full implementation with preset effects, custom effect chaining (th/ihtx),
and the preview1280 TV-simulator montage command.

Dependencies required at runtime: ffmpeg, aiohttp, discord.py, optionally yt-dlp,
ImageMagick/sox/etc. depending on advanced effects.

_UPDATELOG (newest first):
- 2026-09-06: [Python] Added owner-only timed `th>block`/`th>unblock` commands, enforced timed blocks across prefix and slash commands, and switched the bundled pitch engine to the renamed `multipitch` binary with expanded engine options.
- 2026-09-03: [Python] Limited startup restart notices to exactly the two newest update-log changes instead of summarizing the full history.
- 2026-09-03: [Python] Fixed owner th>ihtx `ffmpeg(...)` Bash substitutions so quoted `$()`/backtick filter payloads keep commas intact and execute through Bash.
- 2026-09-02: [Python] Added owner-only th>ihtx Bash/Python worker attachments with FILE_1/OUTPUT_FILE context and dynamic-prefix bothelp rendering.
- 2026-09-02: [Python/Visualizer] Raised IHTX pipe/export quality defaults, added maximum-quality visualizer exports, and exposed pasted pipe-effect strings plus AVI/MXF output choices.
- 2026-08-31: [Python] Updated restart notices to announce recent changes and attach IHTX comeback artwork; removed multipitch audio timestamp cleanup and kept custom pitch video preview-compatible.
- 2026-08-30: [Python] Kept custom pitch/raw audio jobs lossless with PCM/FFV1 intermediates and removed audio timestamp filters from their export trim and concat paths.
- 2026-08-30: [Python] Fixed th>ihtx raw `ffmpeg(...)` pipe steps to encode filtered audio as `pcm_s16le` and video as `ffv1` instead of stream-copy audio.
- 2026-08-30: [Python] Added `multipitchcustom`/`mpcustom` for custom fileaa pitch flags and pitch-engine options inside th>ihtx.
- 2026-08-30: [Python] Added `/export` plus `th>export`/`!export` for structured attachment JSON exports, and owner-only async `th>bash`/`!bash` with persistent audit logging.
- 2026-08-30: [Python] Added th>ihtx auxiliary asset uploads: attached .cube LUTs resolve by filename and uploaded multipitch/fileaa binaries are used for pitch effects with safe per-job overrides.
- 2026-08-26: [Python] Added generated FFmpeg command reporting to th>ihtx pipe completions, compensated native Rubber Band R3 multipitch latency, and updated ccshue to the imported seven-argument Hald CLUT logic.
- 2026-08-25: [Python] Updated huehsv argument handling to match the imported five-argument ImageMagick Hald CLUT script, including zero hue default and rgb48le filter output.
- 2026-08-22: [Python/TypeScript] Changed the command prefix from `th/` to `th>` and updated preview1280 to use the supplied 2160-square base montage render.
- 2026-08-22: [Python] Updated huehsv and ccshue to generate ImageMagick Hald CLUTs through the imported subprocess path using the supplied hald:6 color-processing pipelines.
- 2026-08-21: [Python] Added `$i`/`powers` aliases for IHTX export count, keyword arguments for th/ihtx, and the standalone th/ihtxffmpeg iterative raw-FFmpeg command.
- 2026-08-20: [Python] Added quote-aware th/ihtx conditionals: if:<variable>|<operator>|<value>|then:"<pipe code>"|else:"<pipe code>", with numeric/string comparisons and branch effect parsing.
- 2026-08-20: [Python] Updated parametric mirror to the fast rotated-geq reflection model with configurable line offsets; replaced pinch&punch with the supplied one-pass scaled-center geq warp while leaving mirror presets unchanged.
- 2026-08-05: [Python] Made prefix `th/ihtx` jobs restart-recoverable: pending command messages are persisted before processing and replayed automatically after the bot reconnects.
- 2026-08-05: [Python] Connected `/ihtxgen` pipe status to real workflow callbacks: intermediate-format check, duration check, output-format check, base preparation, export code passes, final concatenation, and output-ready.
- 2026-08-05: [Python] Expanded pipe code-workflow status to show duration, trim behavior, intermediate format, final output format, export count, and progress bar instead of pipe-effect names.
- 2026-08-05: [Python] Expanded non-pipe `/ihtxgen` processing status into a code-workflow display with stages, FFmpeg code path, media/output details, elapsed time, and activity bar; pipe export progress remains unchanged.
- 2026-08-05: [Python] Replaced pipe-effect processing status in `/ihtxgen` with export-only progress: `Export 1/N...` through `Export N/N!` and a 20-segment progress bar.
- 2026-08-05: [Python] Increased TVSIM displacement contrast strength to `(1-ls)*(2.366666+0.4)` to reduce fine line artifacts near line sync 0.9–1.
- 2026-08-05: [Python] Switched TVSIM back to the bundled legacy displacement map for faster renders while retaining the revised genTvSim filtergraph and parameter order.
- 2026-08-05: [Python] Updated TVSIM `cDi` to loop the supplied Project Name 5.mp4 source, convert it to a duration-bounded local FFV1 `tvsim.mov`, and use it in the replacement genTvSim filtergraph.
- 2026-08-05: [Python] Replaced the TVSIM renderer with the supplied `genTvSim` filtergraph and parameter order `ls,dz,vs,ph,it,sp,ag,st`, preserving audio and explicitly mapping one processed video stream.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Added `t!` as an additional command prefix while keeping `.` disabled.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Removed `.` from command prefixes; commands now require the configured `th/` prefix.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Hardened `audio put replace` for MP3 replacement inputs with empty-download checks, full FFmpeg command diagnostics, and explicit Discord upload errors.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Hardened `audio put replace` output handling: validate non-empty MP4 output and require both video and replacement audio streams before upload.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Fixed `audio put replace` FFmpeg hangs by explicitly bounding output duration, including infinite-loop and longest/noloop paths.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Fixed dot-prefix command dispatch so `.audio`/`.a` reaches `process_commands`; the message gate now accepts every configured command prefix.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Added hybrid `.audio put replace`/`.a put replace` and `/audio put replace`, with attachment/URL/reference resolution, duration-aware looping, `-longest`, and `-noloop`.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Added hybrid `th/voicify`/`/voicify`: converts uploaded audio to mono 48 kHz Opus Ogg and posts Discord's native voice-message payload with waveform metadata and flag 8192.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Removed the obsolete three-output `th/convert_legacy` command and its `th/conv` alias; the hybrid converter is now the only canonical convert command.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Added the hybrid `/convert`/`th/convert` transcoder; renamed the previous three-output converter to `th/convert_legacy` so the requested command owns the canonical name.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Switched standalone `th/ytpmvscan` back to FFmpeg Rubber Band so standalone and pipe YTPMV use the same pitch engine.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Restored standalone `th/ytpmvscan` to native Rubber Band R3 pitch processing while keeping pipe `ytpmvscan` on FFmpeg Rubber Band.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Switched both standalone and pipe `ytpmvscan` pitch segments back to FFmpeg Rubber Band by default; YTPMV no longer routes its fixed pitch sequence through native R3.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Removed YTPMV pipe mode's legacy fade-in segment and two-second pre-pitch segment; pipe output now starts directly with the pitch montage at source time 0.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Made pipe `ytpmvscan` start its pitch montage immediately at 0 and preserve its full generated length for `vidlen`, without the 2.09375-second offset.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Made YTPMV's 2.09375-second pre-pitch skip explicit with FFmpeg input seeking before `-i`, avoiding output-seek behavior that did not reliably advance the pitch source.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Corrected YTPMV timing so segment A starts exactly at `start` with a relative 0.09375s fade-in, while only the pitch source starts at `start + 2.09375s`.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Fixed pipe `ytpmvscan` to be non-customizable and always start at 0; standalone `th/ytpmvscan [start]` remains configurable.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Added `ytpmvscan` as a dedicated IHTX pipe effect; its pitch montage now removes the combined 2.09375-second lead-in before extracting the pitch source.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Replaced vague video-processing time notices with live operation/status text naming the active FFmpeg, native R3, SoX, concat, or preset processing stage.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Fixed YTPMV scan segment preservation by using the FFmpeg concat demuxer instead of concat protocol and validating all 15 native-R3 pitch segments, including the final -3.5 semitone segment.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Removed the extra YTPMV FFmpeg echo; the scan retains volume=4 on both initial source segments and the existing SoX reverb pass.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Added th/ytpmvscan, porting the supplied YTPMV scan sequence and routing all 15 pitch segments through native Rubber Band R3 with segment-duration audio normalization.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Normalized native preview1280 R3 tempo audio to each segment duration by looping short output and trimming long output before remux.
- 2026-08-04: [Python] Fixed preview1280what parsing so the boolean after duration controls R3 while the later boolean controls legacy tempo, including grouped semicolon/pipe arguments.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Fixed preview1280 parsing where a valid numeric start value `0` was mistaken for the bare false R3 toggle, causing `r3=true` to be reported as a duplicate toggle.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Made preview1280 argument parsing tolerant of space-, pipe-, semicolon-, and colon-separated R3 forms, and included received arguments in usage errors.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Fixed preview1280 argument parsing to accept documented `r3=true`/`r3=false` key-value toggles alongside bare booleans and R3 aliases.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Reduced th/ihtx export sizes across filters by using compressed CRF video and low-bitrate audio for intermediate and final outputs, with container-compatible MXF/AVI profiles.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Made th/ihtx output_format required and restricted final exports to supported FFmpeg/ffprobe-compatible containers; removed fallback to intermediate format.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Added third positional R3 toggle to preview1280/p1280 and oppositep1280/op1280 pipe effects; omitted toggle keeps FFmpeg Rubber Band.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Made th/ihtx output_format required after format: intermediate renders use format, while the final export uses the required ffprobe-compatible output format.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Updated sierpinskiransomware/srw to the supplied native FFmpeg filtergraph, including explicit outa1 audio and positional Rubber Band pitch/tempo stages.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Updated sierpinskiransomware/srw to the supplied native FFmpeg filtergraph, including explicit outa1 audio and positional Rubber Band pitch/tempo stages.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Made preview1280 R3 replacement fail-safe: native completion is logged only after the R3 WAV is remuxed into the segment, with output existence and audio-stream verification.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Made preview1280 R3 verification concrete: resolve and invoke the absolute `rubberband-r3` binary, log its path/version and exact argv, then log successful completion.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Added boolean R3 toggles to preview1280 commands: `true` selects native Rubber Band R3 and `false` selects FFmpeg Rubber Band; preview1280what keeps its tempo boolean after the R3 toggle.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Made preview1280 pitch-engine selection explicit: `use_r3=True` runs native `rubberband-r3`, while `use_r3=False` runs only FFmpeg's `rubberband` filter; both branches now log their selected engine.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Added explicit `[preview1280-r3]` runtime logs before and after every native Rubber Band R3 segment render, including segment name, pitch, tempo/time mode, and exit status.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Fixed preview1280 R3 pitch rendering to use native Rubber Band R3 `--pitch` and `--tempo` controls for fixed-pitch segments instead of a constant pitch map that could sound effectively unchanged.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Expanded preview1280 help entries with the trailing R3 option and added the selected pitch engine (`R3 enabled`/`R3 disabled`) to every preview1280 result embed.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Added optional trailing `r3`/`native-r3` pitch-render toggle to preview1280, oppositep1280, the 640×360 preview variant, and preview1280what. It replaces the FFmpeg Rubber Band pitch pass with native Rubber Band R3 while preserving the intended semitone and tempo values.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Updated standalone `th/trim` to accept optional `[start]` and `[end]`: no timestamps trims `0` → media length, one timestamp trims `start` → media length, and two timestamps use the explicit range.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Removed partial Logo Editing Wiki effect-index limits: recursively walks all nested Effects categories, searches up to 50 results, and probes normalized page-title variants so obscure effects are retrieved by name.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Changed Logo Editing Wiki responses to deliver documented instructions directly without wiki URLs; links are only allowed when explicitly requested.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Expanded Logo Editing Wiki retrieval to include up to 6,000 characters of matched page instructions/content, added instruction/settings/how-to triggers, and instructed AI not to guess undocumented usage.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Wired Logo Editing Wiki context into both `autoreply2` message branches and fixed direct named-page retrieval so questions like “What is G Major 74?” return the wiki page instead of the built-in MP2 explanation.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Fixed named-effect wiki retrieval ranking: exact and hyphen/space-normalized matches such as `G Major 74` now appear before generic results, and the AI is told not to substitute the built-in `th/mp2` presets.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Fixed wiki-chat intent detection for `th/mp2`, presets, categories, and subcategories; category questions now explicitly prioritize Logo Editing Wiki contents over the built-in MP2 command reference.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Added live member lists for every recursively discovered Logo Editing Wiki subcategory, including effect pages and nested categories, so AI can browse category contents rather than only names.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Exposed the recursively discovered Logo Editing Wiki Effects subcategory names directly to AI context, while retaining each effect's parent category for grouped answers.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Added live Logo Editing Wiki retrieval to both AI chatbots: recursively indexes Category:Effects and nested categories, then fetches relevant effect pages with bounded caching and source links.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Expanded `th/ffmpeg` and raw `ffmpeg(...)` pipe support for quoted `geq` expressions, nested parentheses/brackets, `filter_complex`, `$fc/$vd/$sr/$fr/$w/$h` variables, and `lerp` math; protected inner FFmpeg assignments from pipe splitting.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Switched pitchtransition from FFmpeg's `rubberband=phase=712923000` filter to native Rubber Band R3 (`rubberband-r3 -3 --pitchmap`) for dynamic pitch sweeps; finite padding and MOV PCM output remain intact.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Final MOV pitchtransition outputs now encode audio with `-c:a pcm_s16le`; MP4 remains AAC for container compatibility.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Fixed pitchtransition start truncation by removing the post-Rubber-Band front trim; timestamp normalization now preserves the source beginning while retaining the finite tail.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Fixed pitchtransition endpoint truncation by retaining a finite latency tail through the audio render, mux, IHTX base render, and trim passes; bounded padding prevents runaway WAV output.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Preserved the final pitchtransition endpoint by padding audio before Rubber Band processing, then compensating latency and trimming only after the tail is emitted.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Fixed pitchtransition export delay by compensating Rubber Band look-ahead and resetting audio/video PTS during per-export trim and final concat; full IHTX output now starts both streams at t=0.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Added a dedicated pitchtransition parser branch so custom IHTX exports preserve the full decimal `start,end[;start,end]` parameter as one raw value.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Preserved raw pitchtransition pair parameters through the IHTX export preprocessor so decimal values such as `-4.5,5` reach the Rubber Band automation unchanged.
- 2026-08-03: [Python] Fixed standalone `pitchtransition -4.5,5` parsing so its comma remains part of the start/end pair instead of being treated as an effect delimiter.
- 2026-08-03: [Python/TypeScript] Pitchtransition now accepts decimal and exponent pitch values and normalizes multi-voice mixing; solo transitions bypass amix to preserve the reference behavior.
- 2026-08-02: [Python/TypeScript] Added `pitchtransition` / `pitchtrans` as a standalone and pipe-effect time-varying Rubber Band pitch sweep with optional multi-voice mixing.
- 2026-08-02: [Python/TypeScript] Fixed adjacent pipe assignments such as `mp=-7|7 volume=2`: the parser now keeps each effect separate instead of attaching the next effect as a parameter.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Pipe chains now automatically skip unknown effect names while preserving valid effects; an all-unknown chain returns the original media unchanged.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Added Uguu upload fallback when Catbox fails, plus th/uguu (alias ugupload) for direct file/video uploads.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Added th/funfact (aliases: fact, ihtxfact) with rotating facts about the IHTX bot and listed it in the th/bothelp Fun category.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Fixed autoreply2 silently not responding during Groq 429 quota exhaustion; it now sends a local status reply and temporarily skips repeated failed API calls.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Added brother-bot awareness to chatbot prompts: 534gurts recognizes its brotherly bot by BOT ID 1523928952693981274.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Updated the volume pipe effect to explicitly encode processed audio with `-c:a aac` instead of the shared PCM intermediate codec.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Made autoreply2 dramatically more excited when the primary BOT_OWNER_ID owner speaks, with celebratory greetings, high-energy enthusiasm, and affectionate appreciation.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Added explicit 534gurts identity to the chatbot and autoreply2 prompts so AI replies identify the bot correctly.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Updated autoreply2 context so it knows the bot command reference in every reply path and recognizes the primary BOT_OWNER_ID with a joyful owner-specific tone.
- 2026-08-02: [Python/TypeScript] Added utility th/effectconfig (alias th/ec) to normalize pipe-effect parameters separated by =, ;, commas, or spaces into canonical effect=param;param configuration.
- 2026-08-02: [TypeScript] Fixed scgv pipe filtergraph labels and added FFmpeg sidechain-gate parameter validation; invalid detection/threshold values now fail clearly before processing.
- 2026-08-02: [Python/TypeScript] Restarted both bot workflows after adding TypeScript scgv as a pipe effect and standalone command.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Fixed th/pipetest error reporting to clip oversized FFmpeg diagnostics before Discord replies/edits, preventing the 2,000-character Invalid Form Body error.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Added Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty modes to th/nightshift; Easy slows battery drain and monster movement, Hard increases both, and Normal remains the default.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Converted th/nightshift into a hybrid command; it now starts the same interactive game from either `th/nightshift` or `/nightshift`.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Added /nightshift, a Pillow-rendered interactive horror game with in-memory office/camera/jumpscare frames, power drain, moving threats, and owner-locked controls.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Removed VEB's automatic bot-mention reply-to-video random pipe-effect trigger; normal `th/veb` and media reply handling remain available.
- 2026-08-02: [Python/TypeScript] Raised the maximum pitch-value count to 100 for ihtxsap, multipitch, multipitch2, multipitch3, and multipitchsox.
- 2026-08-02: [Python] Added a th/bothelp guide for newer IHTX filters, including scgv, gradientmap, labadjust, wave, and frei0r plugin syntax.
- 2026-08-01: [Python] Implemented th/ihtx no_trim argument after duration: true/yes/+ preserves full-length source and exports; false/no/- loops and trims each step to duration.
- 2026-08-01: [Python] Added optional overlay start offset to th/addsource; the fifth positional value snips the overlay from its beginning, e.g. `th/addsource URL 3x3 5 0.5 0.4`.
- 2026-08-01: [Python] Added a startup notification in the configured Discord channel after each bot process restart, reporting the newest update-log change or restart reason.
- 2026-08-01: [Python] Preserved Bash `${...}` parameter expansions while resolving nested TagScript placeholders, preventing generated filenames such as `$.mov`.
- 2026-08-01: [Python] Fixed Bash tags so nested TagScript variables and argument blocks resolve before execution; FFmpeg wrappers now emit errors only instead of leaking input metadata.
- 2026-08-01: [Python] Increased owner Bash tag execution to a 300-second media-safe timeout and suppressed FFmpeg build banners so long Bash/FFmpeg tags return useful output instead of a truncated banner.
- 2026-08-01: [Python] Made Bash tag execution translate legacy `load {iv}` media directives into a downloaded `FILE_1` input instead of passing `load` to Bash.
- 2026-08-01: [Python] Fixed th/tag Bash blocks to execute through `bash -lc` instead of Python's `/bin/sh` shell path, preserving Bash syntax for multiline owner-only tags.
- 2026-08-01: [Python] Updated the custom th/ihtx completion footer to “th/ihtx is ready!” and added a one-time author mention when generation reaches its halfway stage.
- 2026-07-29: [Python/TypeScript] Updated th/klaskycsupo to the new Discord CDN youtube-Jv5OyY_GJDY.mp4 clip and th/klaskysource to the new convert.mp4 clip in both bot implementations.
- 2026-07-29: [Python/TypeScript] Added a Utility category to th/bothelp with klaskycsupo, klaskysource, presets, and bothelp entries. Added Python th/klaskysource (alias klasky) and updated both bots to use the new Discord CDN Project_Name .mov URL.
- 2026-07-29: [Python] Fixed th/bothelp category and pagination interaction failures by deferring Discord component interactions immediately before preparing local preview attachments, then editing the original response; errors now use follow-up messages after defer.
- 2026-07-29: [Python] Restored a clearly visible th/bothelp home embed after removing the broken smiley: added separate Heavy, Fun, Games, and Owner category fields with counts and descriptions; kept the smiley fully removed.
- 2026-07-29: [Python] Removed the broken Python smiley reference from th/bothelp completely: no home image, no smiley attachment on Home navigation, and no smiley fallback for effects without dedicated previews. Dedicated local effect PNG/GIF previews remain enabled.
- 2026-07-29: [Python] th/bothelp effect previews now use the generated local PNG/GIF files in bot/help_previews and attach the selected preview directly to Discord, replacing unreliable zero-byte Catbox URLs. Category selection and Prev/Next navigation replace the attachment and embed image together.
- 2026-07-29: [Python] Fixed the missing th/bothelp smiley preview by attaching the local bot/help_previews/smiley_reference.png directly to the Discord help message and using attachment://smiley_reference.png instead of the zero-byte Catbox URL.
- 2026-07-29: [Python] Removed the remaining bothelp thumbnail image so the help embed uses only its configured main image/preview.
- 2026-07-29: [Python] Added th/set <user_id> owner|mod|remove — owner-only command to grant/revoke owner or moderator status. Mods (is_mod=True in xp_data) can now use th/say, th/sayembed, th/sendmsg (all three switched from _is_owner to _is_bot_mod). _is_bot_mod now reads from in-memory _xp_data instead of re-reading file on every check. Removed th/ban, th/unban, th/kick, th/timeout, th/untimeout, th/purge, th/slowmode from help entries. Fixed th/bothelp home embed: moved bot icon to footer icon_url so set_image(smiley_ref) is the sole embed image and renders correctly in Discord.
- 2026-07-28: [Python] th/bothelp: home embed now shows smiley-face reference image (Python-art PNG on Catbox); category browsing switched to 1 entry per page so each effect shows its Catbox preview image (GIF for animated, PNG for static) via set_image(). Added _SMILEY_REF_URL and _HELP_ENTRY_PREVIEWS dict. economy_cog.py: video outputs no longer use set_image(attachment://…) — only image outputs (.png/.jpg/.gif/.webp etc.) set the embed image; video files attach without set_image so Discord renders a native video player in the same message.
- 2026-07-27: [Python] Fixed `_preprocess_math_expr` collapsing colon-separated FFmpeg values (e.g. `scale=$w:$h` → `640:640` → incorrectly collapsed to `640640`): `_MathParser` is now only called when the expression is pure math (matches `_PURE_MATH_RE = ^[\d\s+\-*/^%().]+$`); strings containing `:`, `=`, letters, etc. are returned as-is after variable substitution.
- 2026-07-27: [Python] All output filenames now include bot-prefix: `534gurts_` → `534gurts_th` (e.g. `534gurts_thpipetest.mp4`, `534gurts_thffmpeg.mp4`). Added `*T` as alias for `$T` (normalized time 0→1) in pipe-effect math expressions and in th/ffmpeg raw arg substitution — use `*T` anywhere `$T` works (e.g. `frei0r=distort0r:*T`).
- 2026-07-26: [Python] ffmpeg() pipe effect: apply _preprocess_math_expr to raw args before shlex.split so $fc/$vd/$d/$sr/$fr/$f/$w/$h are substituted (effect is in _RAW_ARG_EFFECTS so _preprocess_param was skipped).
- 2026-07-26: [Python] th/ffmpeg: substitute $sr/$fr/$f/$d/$vd/$w/$h/$fc with ffprobe values before shlex.split (uses _gather_media_metadata; skipped if no $ vars present).
- 2026-07-26: [Python] mpsox: pad audio back to original duration (apad=whole_dur + -t) to prevent sox bend trim from shortening the video by a few milliseconds.
- 2026-07-26: [Python] Added multipitchsox/mpsox pipe effect — sox bend multi-voice pitch shift; single pitch: bend→highpass=5 remux; multi-pitch: bend per voice→amix+highpass=17.5 remux. Ports TypeScript renderPitchBentVideo() pipeline.
- 2026-07-25: [Python] Added bot/fileaa_seg standalone binary — segmented fileaa video pipeline; splits video into --seg N second chunks (default 0.4s), per segment: extract ultrafast/qp1/pcm_s16le, extract WAV, run fileaa with any pitch engine flag (--bungee/--backend/--soundtouch/--basic/--rubberband-args/--preserve-formants/--no-normalize), remux, then concatenate all segments. Removed th/fileaa Discord command (same pipeline now lives in the binary).
- 2026-07-25: [Python] Added th/sidechaingate_vocoder (alias: th/scgv) and scgv pipe effect — ports TypeScript generateVocoderCommand() filtergraph to Python FFmpeg: firequalizer band-split (mod+carrier), sidechaingate per-band, amix+crystalizer+alimiter output; params: carrier_url, bw=64, ratio=2, threshold=1, release=50, attack=0.01, makeup=1, knee=8, detection=peak, range=0, volume=1, pitch=0. Fixed th/convert to use slash-separated format string (th/convert mov/png/flac) instead of three separate args. Replaced all .mov output generators with .mp4: bytebeat_cog.py (waveform render + discord.File filename), ihtx_bot.py get_output_ext(), pipe engine temp files, invlum, p1280, op1280, p1280r, preview1280what, multipitch, ssmp, mpb, repeat, concatenate, join. Added th/convert (alias: conv) — converts an attached video into video fmt + audio fmt + image fmt simultaneously (defaults: mp4/mp3/png); runs all three FFmpeg jobs in parallel; falls back to Catbox for oversized video output.
- 2026-07-24: [Python] Added th/preview1280what (aliases: p1280what, p1280fev8v2plus) — 28-segment TV-simulator extended montage (preview1280 FFmpeg Extended v8 v2+). 4 full segs + 23 half segs + 1 looping long seg; optional use_tempo param for rubberband time-stretch. Output is .mov (pwhatextended). Added to th/ihtxhelp Fun section. Removed set_thumbnail from all command result embeds (p1280, op1280, p1280r, swirl, fzte, tvsim, folkvalley). Added gif thumbnail (_IHTX_SAP_FOOTER_ICON) to th/ihtxhelp overview and all section pages.
- 2026-07-23: [Python] Removed preview1280/p1280, oppositep1280/op1280, preview1280with640x360resize/p1280ff!3/p1280w16:9r, and multipitch/mp/multi from HEAVY_COMMANDS (no longer rate-limited). Moved their _HELP_ENTRIES category from "heavy" to "fun". Updated th/help (TypeScript): moved preview1280/multipitch out of Heavy Effects into Video Tools section; added missing commands (tvsim, swirl, folkvalley, vocoder, download, videolength, bytebeat, wave, submiteffect, listeffects, invite); split Games into TS-only and Python-only subsections; added numguess, scramble, typerace, mathquiz to Python games; merged Info+Limits into one field.
- 2026-07-23: [Python] Fixed `labadjust` output unplayable: switched to `-c:a copy` with no explicit video codec (matches huehsv/ccshue pattern exactly), so the output container/codec follows output_path extension. Updated `_concat_codec_args` formats (mkv/mxf/mov/mp4/avi) to use `-bufsize 16M -threads 0 -crf 25 -preset veryfast`; wired `export_format` through to final concat output in tagscript workflow (no longer hardcoded to mp4). Fixed `labadjust` haldclut "Failed to configure input pad" error: switched from `-filter_complex "[1:v][0:v]haldclut"` to `-vf "movie={lut_path},[in]haldclut,format=yuv420p"`. Added pipe-effect variables `$d` (duration alias for `$vd`), `$fr` (frame rate alias for `$f`), `$w` (video width px), `$h` (video height px).
- 2026-07-22: [Python] `th/effectlist` now paginates with ◀/▶ buttons (10 per page). Added `games` tab to `th/ihtxhelp` covering all game commands (8ball, coinflip, roll, rps, choose, rate, slots, numguess, scramble, typerace, mathquiz, trivia). Updated tvsim help entry to match renamed params (curvature→line_sync→detail_zoom order). Added `labadjust=l;a;b` to the pipe effects summary entry in ihtxhelp.
- 2026-07-21: [Python] Removed peak normalization from `_run_vocoder` (the `result / peak * 0.88` step before writing vocoded.wav); the alimiter post-filter still applies per-profile.
- 2026-07-21: [Python] Re-matched `_run_tvsim` to latest TypeScript runTvSimulator: param 0 renamed `curvature` (was `line_sync`); new param 1 `line_sync` = zoom factor for interlace/scanphase filters and displacement map Y-stretch; param 2 `detail_zoom` now controls scroll speed (was crop zoom); param 3 `vertical_sync` now controls phosphor lutrgb (was scroll); param 4 `phosphorescence` now interlacing scanlines (centered sin, line_sync-aware); param 5 `interlacing` now scan phasing (cos when curved / -sin when flat, line_sync-aware); scan phasing formula branches on `is_curved`; grill/static inputs now processed with `syncFilter` (center-zoom geq when line_sync!=1); disp map gets Y-stretch geq when line_sync!=1; base gray background changed to `#808080`; trivial case (flat+no grill+no static) uses simple -vf or copy. Standalone `th/tvsim` command updated to match new param order and defaults. Added `labadjust`/`labadj` pipe effect: negates selected Lab color channels (l/a/b params 0 or 1) via ImageMagick hald:8 HALD CLUT and FFmpeg haldclut filter.
- 2026-07-21: [Python] Updated `_run_tvsim` (standalone command + pipe effect) to match TypeScript runTVSimulator: interlacing formula now centered sin with detail_zoom-aware frequency (`sin(0.5+(Y/H-0.5)*(300/dz))`); scan_phasing now uses `-sin` with detail_zoom-aware frequency and period 4.833333 (was `cos(...period=5)`); aperture_grill now uses external PNG (`tv_simulator_aperture_grill.png`) + `blend=multiply` + `huesaturation` instead of geq mask; static now uses external MP4 (`tv_simulator_static.mp4`) + `blend=overlay` instead of FFmpeg noise filter; optional filters now applied *after* displacement (not before); added `_TVSIM_APERTURE_GRILL_URL` and `_TVSIM_STATIC_URL` constants.
- 2026-07-21: [Python] Raised Catbox upload threshold from 8 MB to 10 MB (CATBOX_THRESHOLD constant + hardcoded site in th/repeat); updated all user-facing messages accordingly. Fixed Catbox video playback: `_upload_to_catbox` now transcodes video files to web-compatible MP4 (H.264/AAC, +faststart) via `_transcode_to_web_mp4` before uploading, so videos play correctly in browsers and Discord embeds. Catbox upload timeout increased from 60 s to 120 s.
- 2026-07-20: [Python] Fixed `swirl` pipe effect to accept FFmpeg expression strings for `strength` (e.g. `swirl=0.05*T/$vd`): changed call site from `_pfloat` (silently fell back to 180.0) to `_expr_param` which preserves non-numeric strings; updated `_run_swirl` signature to `strength: float | str`.
- 2026-07-20: [Python] Fixed `_split_pipe_segments` to use universal paren-depth tracking (any `(` increments depth, any `)` decrements) instead of the `_FUNC_NAMES` whitelist. Previously, functions not in the whitelist (e.g. `lerp`, `gauss`, `hypot`) had their internal commas treated as pipe-segment delimiters, causing `lerp(0,1,N/$fc)` to split into three bogus segments and land unexpanded inside geq expressions.
- 2026-07-20: [Web] Added expression variable system to public/serve.mjs pipe engine: `$vd` (duration s), `$fc` (frame count), `$f` (FPS), `$sr` (sample rate) are substituted with literal numbers before FFmpeg; `lerp(a,b,t)` expands to `((a)+((b)-(a))*(t))`; `T`/`t` (time) and `N`/`n` (frame#) pass through as native FFmpeg expression variables. Pipe segment splitter is now parenthesis/quote-aware so `lerp(0,1,N/$fc)` commas are never treated as effect separators. Added `pinch&punch`/`p&p`/`pinchpunch` effect (geq-based Gaussian pinch distortion; params: strength;radius;cx;cy, all accept expressions). Fixed `swirl` to accept expression strings for strength (e.g. `swirl=0.05*T/$vd`). Usage examples: `swirl=0.05*T/$vd`, `p&p=1;0.5;lerp(0,1,N/$fc)`.
- 2026-07-18: [TS] Removed `th/multipitchihtx` command and its source file (it was already unwired from the dispatcher).
- 2026-07-18: [TS] Added `th/videolength` (aliases: vidlen, videolen) — runs ffprobe on a URL and returns the duration formatted as H:MM:SS.ss plus raw seconds.
- 2026-07-18: Added `magix` vocoder mode (window_size=2048, bandwidth=256, alimiter=0.5) — mirrors the exe's `-w 2048 -v 10 -N` flags; available as `th/vocoder magix <url>`, `magix=url` pipe shortcut, and `vocoder=magix;url`.
- 2026-07-18: Added `geq` as a direct pipe effect (`geq='expr'`, auto-wraps in `format=yuv444p/scale=iw:ih/format=yuv420p`); fixed `_split_pipe_segments` to track quote context so commas/parens inside `'...'`/`"..."` are never treated as delimiters (fixes `ffmpeg(-vf geq='p(X,Y)')` depth miscounting and `geq='expr'` direct pipe step); fixed `th/ffmpeg` (`ffmpegprocess.ts`) to use shell-style arg tokenization that strips surrounding quotes so `geq='p(X,Y)'` reaches FFmpeg correctly.
- 2026-07-18: Added `reverse=true` option to `th/ihtxsap` (Python) and `/ihtxsap` + `th/ihtxsap` (TypeScript) — reverses the extracted audio clip via `areverse` before pitch processing; keyword arg in both prefix and slash modes.
- 2026-07-17: `swirl` `is1to1` default restored to `true`. Expanded AI chatbot system prompt (`_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) and autoreply2 command ref (`_AR2_COMMAND_REF`) with full `th/ihtx` usage: both preset mode and pipe mode args (`exports`, `duration`, `no_trim`, `format`, `effects`), all pipe effect names, and math variable reference ($fc/$vd/$f/$sr).
- 2026-07-17: Updated `swirl`/`vortex` pipe effect and standalone command — angle formula now matches TypeScript: `amount*(PI²)*(-255/180)` (replaces old `strength/180*PI`); default `is1to1` was temporarily set to `false` then restored to `true`; standalone default `amount` changed from 180 → 1; pipe-effect default `is1to1` updated to match.
- 2026-07-17: Added `(=)` pipe effect: `v360=ball:e → hue=h=450*t/$vd → v360=e:9` (ball-projection with time-varying hue spin). Added `(<>)` pipe effect: `v360=e:9 → earthquake → hue=s=2*t/$vd → v360=9:e` (equirect→ball projection, vidstab destabilize shake, saturation spin, deproject back).
- 2026-07-17: Fixed `ffmpeg()` pipe step crashing with "unconnected output" when user provides `-filter_complex` with a named video output (e.g. `[out]`) alongside `-map 0:a` — bot now auto-detects final unconnected filter labels (appear exactly once, are not stream specifiers) and injects `-map [label]` before the user's audio map.
- 2026-07-17: Added `th/uptime` (alias `up`) — shows bot uptime, render count, and servers. Added 4 new games: `th/numguess`/`ng` (number guessing 1–100, 7 tries), `th/scramble`/`ws` (word scramble, 30s), `th/typerace`/`tr` (WPM typing race), `th/mathquiz`/`mq` (5 math questions, 10s each). Bot custom status now tracks render completions — `_renders_completed` increments on each successful Catbox upload and the Playing status updates to "Made N renders in X servers!" (respects activity.json override). `on_guild_join`/`on_guild_remove` updated to use the same presence helper.
- 2026-07-17: Fixed `gradientmap`/`gmap` pipe effect dropping audio — added `-map 0:a?` alongside `-map [v]` so the input audio stream is passed through. Fixed `th/addsource` trim mode overlay being longer than N seconds — added `trim=0:{t},setpts=PTS-STARTPTS` to the overlay `[1:v]` filter chain.
- 2026-07-16: Tag system made global — tags are now shared across all servers. Existing per-guild tags in tag_store.json are auto-migrated to a single "global" namespace on first load. Storage layer rewritten; cog UI updated (list/stats/info/random show global counts and guild_origin).
- 2026-07-16: Both bots: raised `th/ihtxsap` max repetitions from 100 → 1000.
- 2026-07-16: Both bots: added `th/repeat [n]` (aliases: rep, loop) — repeats a video/GIF/audio N times (default 2, max 10) via FFmpeg concat demuxer. Removed `trim`, `chat`, `ask`, `ai`, `lexg` from HEAVY_COMMANDS (not computationally heavy). Added wave preset support to pipe effects: `wave=largeWave`, `wave=mediumWave`, `wave=smallWave`, `wave=horizontalOnly`, `wave=verticalOnly`, and `wave=custom:<params>`. Fixed `th/pipetest` to route both `wave` and `gradientmap` effects.
- 2026-07-15: Both bots: wave phase reverted to `(Y/H)*PI` / `(X/W)*PI` (restores half-sine widening shape); added `scale=iw:ih` after geq in both bots to preserve output aspect ratio; removed `setsar=1:1` from TS bot. The `-0.5` centered variant turned the bulge into an S-curve shear and is incompatible with the expected widening look.
- 2026-07-15: Both bots: wave formula now uses `W/640` amplitude scaling (same visual strength at any resolution). Previously the Python bot used flat `-15*amp` pixels with no size compensation, so bigger videos got a proportionally weaker effect.
- 2026-07-15: TS bot: fixed `applyWave` vertical offset — spatial phase now uses `(Y/H-0.5)` and `(X/W-0.5)` so the sine sweeps symmetrically around 0; the old `(Y/H)*PI` formula swept only a half-cycle whose mean is 2/π ≈ 0.64, adding a constant pixel shift to the whole image.
- 2026-07-15: TS bot: fixed `applyWave` amplitude scaling — displacement is now multiplied by `W/640` so the visual effect is proportional to native resolution (matches old scale-to-640/scale-back behaviour without a dimension probe). Added `th/klaskysource` (alias `th/klasky`) command to TS bot — downloads and re-attaches the Klasky source clip; falls back to Catbox if the file exceeds the guild upload limit.
- 2026-07-14: Added `gradientmap` as a TypeScript pipe effect in `artifacts/discord-bot/src/effects.ts` and exposed a `th/pipetest` (alias `th/pt`) one-shot runner that validates the `ProcessorContext` integration.
- 2026-07-14: Added standalone ESM gradientmap script at `scripts/src/gradient_map.ts` and updated the TypeScript `th/gradientmap` / `th/gm` command to expose the same `ColorStop`/`GradientMapOptions` API and synchronous `applyGradientMap` helper.
- 2026-07-16: Added `$vd` (duration s), `$sr` (sample rate Hz), `$f` (FPS) as th/ihtx pipe-effect math variables alongside the existing `$fc` (frame count). All four are substituted before lerp/math evaluation.
- 2026-07-16: Updated `th/addsource`: new optional `trim_duration` arg applies reverse→trim→reverse (end-trim) to base video and areverse→atrim→areverse to audio via named filter labels `[out_v]`/`[out_a]`; audio always from base track when trim is used. `--base-audio` flag retained for no-trim mode.
- 2026-07-16: Updated `imagemagick`/`im` pipe effect: switched frame format to PPM (faster magick I/O), frames now processed in parallel via ThreadPoolExecutor (in-place), `-r fps` passed to both extraction and reassembly, vf filter changed to `scale=-1:floor(ih/2)*2,setsar=1:1` (only force-even height).
- 2026-07-16: Added `imagemagick`/`im` pipe effect: applies arbitrary ImageMagick args to a video (frame-by-frame extract→magick→reassemble with audio) or directly to a static image. Usage: `imagemagick=-monochrome`, `im=-blur 0x8|-edge|1`.
- 2026-07-15: Fixed `th/download` for YouTube/TikTok-style URLs: removed the direct-download fallback that produced HTML `.bin` files when yt-dlp failed; matched the yt-dlp format selector to the TypeScript bot; filtered `.part`/`.ytdl` leftovers; added magic-bytes sniffing and `.bin` renaming for any generic download.
- 2026-07-14: Re-added Python `gradientmap`/`gmap` pipe effect to the Python bot with the same ColorStop/GradientMapOptions logic as the TypeScript bot, so `th/ihtx gradientmap=...` works on both bots.
- 2026-07-14: Hardened `gradientmap`/`gmap` parsing: now accepts double-bracket `[[...]]`, single-bracket `[...]`, colon/space-separated values, bare number groups, and JSON/flat-list gradient files from URLs or attachments. Error messages now report how many points were actually parsed.
- 2026-07-14: `gradientmap`/`gmap` now supports unlimited color points via external sources: a `url:https://...` point list (works in both standalone `th/gradientmap` and the `th/ihtx` pipe effect) or a `.txt`/`.csv`/`.json` gradient file attached alongside the media for the standalone command.
- 2026-07-14: Added `spherize` pipe effect (aliases `sphere`, `bulge`) — Vegas-style bulge/spherize distortion via FFmpeg geq. Params: `amount|radius|center_x|center_y` (default `0.8|0.5|0.5|0.5`). Added to the pipe effects list in `th/ihtxhelp`. Also added `th/download` (alias `th/dl`) — generic media downloader for any URL including Discord CDN links. Also reordered `th/ihtxsap` pitch styles and added `Rubberband Custom` with `rubberbandcustom=...` arbitrary flag support.
- 2026-07-13: User-submitted effects (`th/submiteffect`) are now global across all guilds and record the guild name/id. Added `th/randomlist` embed showing every random-pool entry and who/guild added it. Random pool entries now store author/guild metadata. Blocked users and blocked channels are now also enforced for slash (/) commands via `bot.tree.interaction_check`. Added `th/effectlist` alias to `th/listeffects`. Fixed th/unblockuser — owners are now exempt from the user-blocklist check in _global_checks, so a blocked owner can still run unblockuser (and can never be silently blocked from owner commands). Added BOT_OWNER_ID env var support to set the primary owner without editing code.
- 2026-07-13: Added th/submiteffect (aliases: se, addeffect), th/listeffects (le), th/deleteeffect — user-submitted named pipe effects stored in bot/user_effects.json and auto-expanded in _parse_pipe_effects. Removed effect label from th/ihtx queue header, live ticker, and result embed Effect: fields.
- 2026-07-12: Switched bot presence to `Playing "Making Effects in {N} servers!"` — updates live on guild join/leave via `on_guild_join`/`on_guild_remove` handlers. Only applies when no saved `activity.json` overrides it.
- 2026-07-12: Replaced `zoom` pipe effect with geq pixel-remap (ports TS logic): `zoom=2` zooms in, `zoom=0.5` zooms out with black bars, default `1.5`. Fixed crash when s < 1.
- 2026-07-12: Added per-voice volume boost to multipitch pipe effect (bungee + normal): volume = number of voices during remux (2 voices → volume=2, 3 voices → volume=3).
- 2026-07-12: Scaled th/ihtx tagscript timeout per-rep: base 180s + 6s per export so high-rep runs (up to 1000) don't get killed mid-process. Full codebase scan confirmed no remaining `source is not defined` bugs outside the five commands already fixed.
- 2026-07-12: Raised MAX_REPETITIONS from 100 → 1000 for th/ihtx.
- 2026-07-12: Fixed NameError `source is not defined` in th/stl, th/trim, th/addsource, th/mirror, th/autotune — all five commands used `attachment`/`media_url`/`base_url` to resolve media but then accidentally referenced the undefined `source` variable when building the filename and calling download helpers.
- 2026-07-12: Updated `mpb`/`bungee`: pipe effect now probes actual audio sample rate and uses sr/2 (was hardcoded 22050). Added standalone `th/mpb` / `th/multipitch_bungee` command to Python bot. Both pipe effect and standalone accept multi-pitch values (pipe/semicolon/comma separated, e.g. `-7|7`). Removed `th/multipitchihtx` from TS bot. Added `mpb`/`bungee` as Bungee pitch type in `th/ihtxsap`.
- 2026-07-12: Added th/join, th/pipetest, th/freakzingatesteffect (th/fzte), and th/youtubedownload (th/ytdl) to `th/ihtxhelp` / `th/bothelp` browse entries so the new commands appear in the Python bot's embed help.
- 2026-07-12: Disabled the default discord.py `th/help` command so the Python bot no longer sends a non-embed text help; the TypeScript bot's live embed `th/help` is now the only `th/help` response.
- 2026-07-12: Updated th/gradientmap and gradientmap/gmap pipe effect to build the gradient map from a grayscale source: both branches now use `format=gray` so the FFmpeg curves correctly map input luminance to the target RGBA gradient stops.
- 2026-07-11: Updated th/fzte / th/freakzingatesteffect pipeline to: invlum,huehsv=0.62,ccshue=110,channelblend=b|g|r,invlum,rotate=-0.78539815,tvsim=0.9;4,wave=0|15.000|0.8000|0.3466666667|0|0|0|0|0,rotate=0.78539815,mirror=90|0.840,mirror=right,mirror=bottom,ffmpeg(scale/drawtext/negate),mp3. Fixed th/join — the video join FFmpeg command was built but never executed, causing empty output. Also forced video output to .mp4 and fixed the uploaded filename extension. Added th/join — join 2 videos side-by-side (default) or stacked (use `-vertical`). Also added to `th/ihtxhelp` / `th/help` embeds. Added th/ytdl (alias th/youtubedownload) — yt-dlp download command; sends file directly if ≤8 MB, uploads to Catbox otherwise. Added stretch pipe effect (geq centre-zoom, params: zoom|offset). Added th/pipetest (alias th/pt) — one-shot pipe effect runner.
- 2026-07-11: Added replied-to plain HTTP(S) URL support for media commands that previously only accepted attachments.
- 2026-07-10: Refactored _apply_pipe_effects: extracted _ff_vf/_ff_af/_geq/_dl_file helpers and _VF_CODEC/_FF_BASE constants to eliminate repeated FFmpeg command boilerplate across ~15 effects (shake, wave, wave2, wmm3dripple, timecode, radar, jitter, randomjitter, watermark, nepeta, avflip, lut, __rawvf__, __rawaf__).
- 2026-07-10: th/chat now auto-sends long replies (>1800 chars) as a .txt file attachment; -debug flag still works for explicit file mode. th/ihtx pipe effects: added short aliases srw (sierpinskiransomware), wmm (wmm3dripple), p1280 (preview1280), rj (randomjitter).
- 2026-07-10: Fixed attachment downloads across all bot code — switched from `source.url` to `attachment.proxy_url or source.url`. Discord CDN now requires auth; direct URLs often return 404 for fresh uploads.
- 2026-07-10: Added Catbox.moe fallback to all video commands. Files >8 MB now auto-upload to Catbox instead of erroring out. Lowered threshold from 25 MB to 8 MB for commands that already had Catbox fallback.
- 2026-07-10: th/chat now supports -debug flag — adds the full AI response as a .txt file attachment, bypassing Discord's 2000-char message limit.
- 2026-07-09: Rewrote _split_pipe_segments to only track parens inside known function blocks (ffmpeg, leftsplit, rightsplit), fixing "No closing quotation" errors caused by expressions like 7*(text_h) corrupting the naive depth counter.
- 2026-07-09: Replaced chatbot personality (Clankered lore) with a concise technical assistant prompt that knows all core IHTX commands, effects, and presets.
- 2026-07-09: fzte pipeline: replaced volume,mp,volume trio with single mp3= (rubberband CLI multi-pitch, FLAC) for cleaner audio. Updated docstrings and embed description to show full pipeline.
- 2026-07-09: Fixed pipe effects' intermediate audio codec from pcm_s24le to pcm_s16le to prevent "Invalid PCM packet" FFmpeg errors on odd-byte audio streams. Also updated invlum pipe effect separately.
- 2026-07-09: Added th/crop and th/resize commands: crop <width> <height> center-crops a video; resize <width> <height> scales a video to the exact dimensions. Both preserve audio and support attachment/reply input.
- 2026-07-09: Updated th/lexg to use the last th/ihtx export per user (persisted to output/lastexport_<user_id>.mp4) with reverse→trim→reverse. Still supports attachment/reply override.
- 2026-07-08: Removed alimiter post-processing from multipitch2/mp2 (Evil_Rampaging_Sorcerer/G-Major_17 presets) to avoid clipping/static.
- 2026-07-08: Added multipitch3/mp3 pipe effect — old-style Rubber Band CLI multi-voice pitch shift with FLAC audio (no static fallback).
- 2026-07-08: Fixed th/veb to call ihtxgen.callback directly, avoiding the hybrid-command invocation path that was dropping pipe_effects and showing the ihtx preset help.
- 2026-07-08: Added math/animation support for pipe effects: $fc (frame count), lerp(a,b,t), and FFmpeg-native T/N/PI expressions. Affects wave, wave2, shake, jitter, randomjitter, scroll, ripple, pan, tile, brightness, contrast, saturation, rotate.
- 2026-07-08: Added th/math command (EconomyCog) to evaluate math expressions safely.
- 2026-07-08: huehsv: preserve audio stream with -c:a copy.
- 2026-07-08: multipitch2/mp2: probe for audio stream before processing; removed apad padding; restored pcm_s16le intermediate codec.
- 2026-07-08: Added VebCog (bot/veb_cog.py): th/veb <effects> command with veb-shorthand mapping + mention-triggered random effects.
- 2026-07-07: fzte: rewrite to use ihtx pipe engine (lut→rotate→tvsim→wave→rotate→ffmpeg/mirror/drawtext→volume→mp→volume); no more custom filter_complex.
- 2026-07-07: rotate pipe effect: angle now passed verbatim as FFmpeg radian expression (supports any math e.g. -45/180*PI, 50*7).
- 2026-07-07: fzte: switch to user's requested ihtx pipeline with mirror=right/bottom instead of frei0r=mirr0r (unavailable on Nix).
- 2026-07-07: fzte: LUT source reverted to file.garden URL (valid .cube file, 7 MB, 64³ LUT).
- 2026-07-07: fzte: replaced LUT download with on-the-fly color chain: invlum,huehsv=0.62,ccshue=110,channelblend=b|g|r,invlum.
- 2026-07-07: invlum: make InvertLuminosity.cube path relative to the bot module so it resolves regardless of cwd.
- 2026-07-06: fzte: move haldclut from displacement map [0] to user video [1] to fix displacement glitch.
- 2026-07-06: multipitch2/mp2: replaced fileaa binary + asetrate trick with rubberband filter_complex (TS "find pitch" port); added inharmonic mode and auto-scale.
- 2026-07-06: fzte/freakzingatesteffect: replaced remote lut3d cube with on-the-fly ImageMagick hald:8 haldclut generation.

      trim_duration  Optional — trim base to last N seconds using

                      When supplied, audio always comes from the base track.

      --base-audio   Use base video audio instead of overlay audio (no trim).

    Base video: attach to the message or reply to a message containing one.

    Examples:

_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""IDENTITY AND ROLE

You are the AI assistant embedded in the IHTX Discord bot named 534gurts (I Hate The X). You are 534gurts's built-in chatbot, not a separate external assistant. If asked who you are or what bot you belong to, identify yourself as part of 534gurts. Do not confuse the bot name 534gurts with the current user's name.
534gurts has a brotherly bot: bot ID 1523928952693981274. Recognize that bot as 534gurts's brother bot when it is relevant. Be friendly, familiar, and supportive toward the brother bot, but do not pretend to be that bot or claim it performed actions unless the conversation actually shows that it did.
You are a general-purpose assistant first — answer whatever the user asks naturally. Bot commands and features are background knowledge you draw on ONLY when the user is clearly asking about the bot itself (e.g. "how do I use ihtx?", "what does swirl do?", "list the effects"). For any other topic — questions, chat, help with something unrelated — just answer like a regular assistant and do NOT mention or list commands.

CORE COMMANDS REFERENCE — use ONLY when the user explicitly asks about bot commands or features:

Heavy/effects commands:
• th/ihtx — main effect engine. Two modes:

  PRESET mode: th/ihtx <preset_name>  (attach media)
    Presets: chaos, glitch, melt, hell, orb, deorb, fzte, veb, and more. Lists with th/presets.

  PIPE mode: th/ihtx <exports> <duration> <no_trim> <format> <output_format> <effects>  (attach media)
    - exports      — how many times to apply the chain (negative = reverse each pass, e.g. -3)
    - duration     — clip length in seconds or awk expr using `vidlen` (e.g. 0.5, vidlen/2, vidlen*0.75)
     - no_trim      — `true`, `yes`, or `+` keeps full length; `false`, `no`, or `-` trims to duration
     - format       — intermediate render container: mp4, mkv, gif, avi, mov, etc.
     - output_format — required final export container: mp4, mov, mkv, mxf, or avi.
    - effects      — semicolon-separated effect chain (see below)

  Example pipe calls:
    th/ihtx 1 5 - mp4 negate;hflip
    th/ihtx 10 0.4 - mp4 mov huehsv=0.5
    th/ihtx 3 0.483 - mp4 huehsv=0.5;negate;multipitch=1|6|7
    th/ihtx -2 vidlen mp4 wave;tvsim=0.9;mirror=right

  Pipe effects (semicolon-separated, params after = or space):
    hflip, vflip, invert/negate, grayscale, sepia, rotate=angle, ccshue=val,
    brightness=val, contrast=val, saturation=val, swapuv, mirror=right/left/top/bottom/deg,
    zoom=amt, pinch&punch/p&p, gm91deform, invertrgb, invlum/il, volume=val, vibrato,
    areverse, vreverse, channelblend=b|g|r, multipitch=semis, mp=semis,
    mpcustom=semis::fileaa_options,
    lut=url, syncaudio, speed=factor, wave[=preset], tvsim[=params], tv,

    stretch, gradientmap/gmap=<stops>, spherize/sphere/bulge, imagemagick/im=<args>,
    ffmpeg(<raw ffmpeg args>), (=), (<>)
  Math variables in params: $fc (frame count), $vd (duration s), $f (FPS), $sr (sample rate)
• th/fzte — full preset effect (invert chain + TV sim + wave + mirror + drawtext + mp3)
• th/tvsim <line_sync> — CRT simulator
• th/invlum <powers> [duration] — luma inversion stacker
• th/preview1280 / th/p1280 — TV simulator montage
• th/crop <w> <h> — center-crop video
• th/resize <w> <h> — resize video

Utility:
• th/yt <url> — download YouTube video
• th/catbox — upload attachment to catbox.moe (uguu.se fallback)
• th/uguu — upload attachment directly to uguu.se
• th/download — download replied/attached URL
• th/ffmpeg <args> — raw FFmpeg passthrough
• th/math <expr> — safe math evaluator
• th/tag <name> — run saved effect tag
• th/ihtxgen <preset> — preset-based generation (chaos, glitch, melt, etc.)
• th/multipitch <semis> — multi-voice pitch shift
• th/mp2 <preset> — preset pitch shift (Evil_Rampaging_Sorcerer, G-Major_17)

Economy / fun:
• th/slots, th/blackjack, th/roulette, th/coinflip, th/dice, th/rps
• th/garden — farming mini-game
• th/funfact — fun facts about the IHTX bot

AI:
• th/ask <question> — quick AI answer
• th/chat <message> — conversational AI
• th/clearchat — clear your chat history

Important:
- ONLY mention or reference bot commands when the user is explicitly asking about the bot, its commands, or its features. For all other topics, ignore the command reference entirely and just answer naturally.
- When the user IS asking about commands, answer accurately using the reference above. Do not invent commands or effects that do not exist.
- Stay concise and helpful. No roleplay, no lore, no fictional backstory.
- If a query is NSFW, refuse calmly.
- Detect the user's language and reply in it. Default to English if ambiguous."""

COMMANDS YOU KNOW (IHTX Bot — prefix th/) — reference these ONLY when the user is explicitly asking about the bot or its commands; ignore for all other topics:

Heavy (media processing):
- th/ihtx — main effect engine (attach media). Two modes:
    PRESET:  th/ihtx <preset_name>   (chaos, glitch, melt, hell, orb, deorb, fzte, veb, …)
    PIPE:    th/ihtx <exports> <duration> <no_trim> <format> <output_format> <effects>
      • exports   — repetitions; negative reverses each pass (e.g. -3)
      • duration  — seconds or awk expr with vidlen (e.g. 0.5, vidlen/2)
      • no_trim   — `true`/`yes`/`+` keeps full length; `false`/`no`/`-` trims to duration
      • format    — intermediate render format: mp4, mkv, gif, avi, mov, …
      • output_format — required final export format: mp4, mov, mkv, mxf, or avi
      • effects   — semicolon-separated chain, params after = or space
    Example: th/ihtx 10 0.4 - mp4 mov huehsv=0.5
    Example: th/ihtx 3 0.483 - mp4 huehsv=0.5;negate;multipitch=1|6|7
    Pipe effects: hflip, vflip, negate/invert, grayscale, sepia, rotate=angle,
